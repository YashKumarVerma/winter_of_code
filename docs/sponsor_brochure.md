# Sponsorship Brochure

We are Mexili, a Free and Open Source organization whose motivation is to funnel learning and implementation through the power of Free and Open Source Software Development.

We are organising a Winter Of Code Program with the aim to introduce programmers to the world of open-source software. Participants are given the opportunity to contribute to our projects and to apply with us to complete them. Participants are mentored by project owners and achieve set goals to complete MWoC successfully.

You can take a look at the program here: https://mexili.github.io/winter_of_code/
